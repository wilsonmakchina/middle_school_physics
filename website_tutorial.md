Updating a website built with **MkDocs** is straightforward. Below is a step-by-step guide to help you update your MkDocs website:

---

### 1. **Make Changes to Your Content**
   - Edit your Markdown files (`.md`) in the `docs` folder (or the folder you specified in your `mkdocs.yml` configuration file).
   - Add new files, update existing ones, or delete outdated content as needed.

---

### 2. **Update the Configuration File (`mkdocs.yml`)**
   - If you need to add new pages, change the site structure, or update settings (e.g., theme, plugins, etc.), edit the `mkdocs.yml` file.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     site_name: My Updated Website
     nav:
       - Home: index.md
       - About: about.md
       - New Page: new_page.md
     theme: readthedocs
     plugins:
       - search
     ```

---

### 3. **Preview Your Changes Locally**
   - Run the following command in your terminal to preview the site locally:
     ```bash
     mkdocs serve
     ```
   - Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to see the changes in real-time.

---

### 4. **Build the Site**
   - Once you're satisfied with the changes, build the site using:
     ```bash
     mkdocs build
     ```
   - This generates the static HTML files in the `site` folder (default location).

---

### 5. **Deploy the Updated Site**
   - If you're using **GitHub Pages**:
     1. Commit your changes to your repository:
        ```bash
        git add .
        git commit -m "Updated website content"
        git push origin main
        ```
     2. Deploy the site using:
        ```bash
        mkdocs gh-deploy
        ```
   - If you're using another hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, or a custom server):
     - Upload the contents of the `site` folder to your hosting provider.

---

### 6. **Verify the Update**
   - Visit your live website to ensure the changes are reflected correctly.
   - If something doesnâ€™t look right, check the terminal logs or your `mkdocs.yml` configuration for errors.

---

### 7. **Optional: Version Control**
   - If you want to maintain versioned documentation, use the **mike** plugin:
     1. Install `mike`:
        ```bash
        pip install mike
        ```
     2. Deploy a new version:
        ```bash
        mike deploy <version>
        ```
     3. Set the default version:
        ```bash
        mike set-default <version>
        ```

---

### 8. **Clean Up (Optional)**
   - If you want to remove old builds or cached files, run:
     ```bash
     mkdocs build --clean
     ```
